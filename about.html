        <p>
            Our founder, Wolfe Edelman, has always associated with a diverse set of people, hailing from all over the world. While there is so much to gain and appreciate about each culture throughout the world, one of his favorite cuisines comes from Thailand. After gaining enough wealth from his career in software development, Wolfe invested in a sizeable, corner location in Bayside, Queens- a community that reflects the multi-cultural essence that Wolfe enjoys surrounding himself with- and opened the doors for his Thai friends and family to creatively display the best their culture's cuisine had to offer. Enjoy the classic Thai-American dishes that have gained popularity in the States, while taking a step into autherntic Asian flavor profiles. The hospitality will sway you to book a trip to Thailand next, and experience the various reasons why Wolfe felt so strongly about opening his new Thai resturant business venture.
